These are the panel printout for the Banggood case: https://www.banggood.com/Electronic-Plastic-Shell-Cartridge-Handle-Project-Case-Desk-Instrument-200x175x70mm-p-1035473.html?cur_warehouse=USA

Currently I only have the front panel as a pdf and when I next take apart my case I will measure out and upload the back panel.
